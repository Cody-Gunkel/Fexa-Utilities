# Fexa Utilities #

## Description
This is a collection of CLI Utilities for https://fexa.io/  
I made this set of tools due to not having them myself, all prototyping is done in PowerShell 5.1, and will eventually be ported over to C# later on. 

*This is a work in progress and will be updated as more utilities are needed

## Installation
1. Start PowerShell 5.1 or greater in the folder downloaded
2. Import the modules using fexa_modules.ps1
3. Login to Fexa using New-FexaLogin
